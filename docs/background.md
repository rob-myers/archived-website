## Possible Overall Approaches

### Website concerning Game AI behaviours.

- Catalog of AI approaches.

...

### Illustrate data-structures/algorithms/state-machines.

- Still relevant to Game AI (which is mainly scripting)
- Examples (rather simplistic):
  - LIFO as lift, or many people hiding in small space
  - FIFO as queue for supermarket
  - Grouping algorithm as coach splitting people into teams
  - Sorting algorithms as stagehand telling actors to go on stage
  - OBDD as factory with robots redirecting data

...

### Make an actual game

- Expose creation process.
- Allow others to participate.
- Clear objective.
- More creative.
