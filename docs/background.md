Themes

- Illustrate algorithms via game
- Illustrate state machines via game
- Game AI/scripting/mechanics
- Shell programming

Originally:
> website is a collection of Game AI behaviours; users can play with code and send comments with modifications/improvements/ideas.

Instead:
> illustrate data-structures/algorithms/state-machines via a top-down game.

Why?
- Far more content exists concerning data-structures and algorithms.
- More educational.
- Still relevant to Game AI (which is mainly scripting)
- Examples:
  - LIFO as lift or many people hiding in small space
  - FIFO as queue for supermarket
  - Grouping algorithm as coach splitting people into teams
  - Sorting algorithms as stagehand telling actors to go on stage
  - OBDD as factory with robots redirecting data
- Can link up to academic work concerning nondeterministic automata
- Could attempt compositionality
