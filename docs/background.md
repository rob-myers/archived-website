Nice to have a story as background.

However, our main aim is:
> to study/compare/catalogue the game AI of top-down games,
  more generally games where a player character ambles through some world

---

An abandoned lower city of The Last Redoubt.
> Can draw inspiration from The Night Land.

An ancient training facility.
> Fits our interest in Game AI.

An outside influence has awakened the facility AI.
> Like [teleglitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2wAPR44IOU).
