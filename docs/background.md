> __Answer__: Simulating human behaviour in a top-down 2D environment.

Each entity is called an _actor_, represented by a circle and an arrow indicating direction. An actor can have things, hold things, speak (via audio or text), and perform other actions dependent on inventory and/or position/direction. Such actors are of central importance to _Game AI_. They may also clarify our own behaviour.


_Ok, so... a bunch of Game AI articles?_

> __Answer__: No. We provide an executable _interactive programming language_ and a _top-down level viewer_. Behaviours are simulated by running one or more _programs_ in a specific level.
