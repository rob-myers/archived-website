_What's this site about?_

> __Answer__: Simulating human behaviour in a top-down 2D environment.

Call a simulated human an [_actor_](). Represent them by a circle with an arrow indicating the direction they face. An actor can _speak_, _have_ things, _hold_ things, and _do_ things dependent on inventory/position/direction. They're central to _Game AI_.


_So... a bunch of Game AI articles?_

> __Answer__: Technology-wise, we provide:
> - an _interactive programming language_ (`bash` in the browser).
> - a _top-down level viewer_ (built using React, SVG and CSS).

_But what about the site's content?_

> __Answer__: Each blog post provides programs, executable by clicking/typing/pasting.
> - Behaviours are simulated by running programs in a level.
> - Users may run their own code.
> - Users may share ideas/code via comments (GitHub account required).

_Ok, so tell me more about the technological features..._
