## Story

_Where_: a military/research base on the far side of the moon.

_Why_: reestablish contact; survive; prevent invasion.

Received a 307 from a pilgrim in the Lunar South-Pole–Aitken Basin.

Kármán-Qian research base went ACK-silent 2 days ago; now the Monorail has shut down. Reestablishing contact has been escalated by UAC Central. You'll go along as our Observer.
