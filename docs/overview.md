# Engine

The `Engine` amounts to:
- the `Level` component and `level.worker` webworker.
- the `Session` component and `os.worker` webworker.

# Blog

The `Blog` amounts to:
- story
- incremental builds via blog posts using `Engine`.

## Story

This includes game setting, plot, characters and level design

- Originally wanted to illustrate Game AI via scripts.
- However, this lacked direction e.g. what drives level design?
- Decided to choose a setting with story and characters.

Heavily inspired by Doom, Quake, Half Life and Teleglitch, although we intend this game to be _humorous_.

Keywords: `military lab`, `teleport`, `demons`.
