### Doom Bible Buildings

#### Hangar Two

The secondary hangar fell into disuse.
It now stores used up equipment, junk, and the room where the soldiers play cards. The hangar has become grungy since it has fallen into disuse. Occasional dripline of oil or rust. Not everything is
perfectly ordered. Stains on floor of hangar.
> 
>  _Basement_
> - _Large Storage Area_: a lot of stuff on palettes. > Storage canisters.
> - _Toilet_: standard toilet, three stalls.
> - _Elevator_: if stay on the elevator long enough, computer voice: “Please do not loiter on the elevator. Thank you.”.
> - _Dispatcher Desk_: desk of the dispatcher.
> - _Elevators_: from hangar bay.
> - _Monorail_: just to depot. One track. You can go this way if you want.
>
> _Ground Floor_
> - _Hangar Bay_: Huge room, with the odd crate. On floor huge 2's and track for landing ship. Crane above. Crane operator booth opposite doors. It may be possible to open the
doors after the power is turned on. Two big elevator platforms can lower to basement if power is on.
> - _Main Exit_: Leads on a path to Supply Depot Two.
> - _Equipment Room_: Locked up Forklift thing, Storage stuff.
> - _Depot Office_: Official and messy looking room.
> - _Break Room_: Messy, microwave, cabinets, tables, Rollee chairs.
> - _Toilets_: Stalls have swinging doors (to show that off)
> - _Elevator_: to second and basement floors.
>
> _Second Floor_
> - _Hangar Control Room_: where they meet to play cards. Large crate surrounded by small crates. Cards drawn on top of crate. In this room there should be 4-minus-thenumber-of-players bodies on the floor. Can have personal palettes corresponding to who
isn't playing. Map on wall with flashing problem areas. Should be at end of hallway, so demons are on your way out. Player starts here.
> - _Offices_: your basic futuristic offices. Desk, screen on wall, cabinets.
> - _Toilets_: need to figure out a generic toilet area to paste everywhere.
> - _Equipment Room_: one of the first place to get items.
> - _Communications Room_: Neat-o computers set into wall. One extruded control desk.
> - _Elevator_. Goes between three floors. Should have up and down and number indicators, maybe a place for lights to go by like in Star Trek.
> - _Crane Operation_: View window out toward crane. Extruded control desk.
> - _Window in hallway_: you can see out onto the surface, and the sky. 

#### Supply Depot Two

Still used as a storage depot, but not as active as the main supply depot. Holds lots of stuff. The supply depot is UAC, in normal UAAF shape because stuff is still routed from here to the other buildings on the base. The monorail tunnels are dull
and utilitarian.

> _Basement_
> - _Monorail Switcher_: from hangar two the underground circuit's two rail system.
> - _Storekeeper's Office_: The guy who actually dispenses material.
> - _Guard/Operator Desk_: Controls access to monorail switcher and elevators.
>
> _Ground Floor_
> - _Storage_: Huge rooms, possibly crate maze, or at least important stuff hidden behind crates. Equivalent of a motor pool is here. Health items hidden in maze. Massive freight
platforms travel to second floor and basement.
>
> _Second Floor_
> 
> More storage, with maze containing storage crates with weapons. Outside, part of the
running track rests on the building

#### Control Center/Power Plant

This is the gateway between the everyday side of the base and the restricted, secret, side. High tech UAC. This is the super-functional, important heart of the base.

> _Basement_
>
> Contains the tunnel to the restricted side of the base.
> - _Main Power Plant_: mazey, full of tech puzzles. Must be navigated to turn on breakers, so power will run to base.

> - _Tool Shop_: where everything is repaired (short cut to first breaker here for those with a Colonel's Hand).
> - _Brig_: where naughty soldiers go. Some trapped possessed humans here. Weapons in a locker here.
>
> _Ground Floor_
> 
> On the normal side, hallways lead to Depot Two, Rec/Training, and Mess. To get through the main security gates, you need a Colonel's Hand. Through these gates
are the hospital, the elevators, and a second set of gates for the passage to the other side.
> - _Operations_: Offices of the nexus of paper pushing and bureaucracy. Many dead.
> - _Hospital_: Gee, would there be medikits here? How about a lot of possessed humans, too? Beds, readouts on wall, cabinets, examination rooms.
> - _Guard Post_: guard second set of gates, and coordinates guard activity.
> - _Offices and Storage_: and so, desks and crates. Demon problems, guarding ammo and supplies. Offices handle communications stuff. Could have readout say that something is missing from tower once you get weapons or mess with info CRT.
